1. The Excel Files: NEEMEANTHRFPAVG.xlsx, NEEMEANTHRACAVG.xlsx contain the data to plot the Average Fluctuation paths and Average Asymmetry coefficients of all fluctuations for all the sites.
2. The Excel Files: C99THRFPAVG.xlsx, C99THRACAVG.xlsx contain the data to plot the Average Fluctuation paths and Average Asymmetry coefficients of top 1% fluctuations for all the sites. These files are also used to produce Figure 3 in th manuscript entitled 'Characterizing Time Asymmetry of Ecosystem Net
Carbon Exchange as a Signature of Thermodynamic
Irreversibility'.
