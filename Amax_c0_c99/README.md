2. The Excel Files : AUGIN99PEAKS.xlsx, CNQIA99PEAKS.xlsx, CNDIN99PEAKS.xlsx, DKSOR99PEAKS.xlsx, ESLJU99PEAKS.xlsx, NLLOO99PEAKS.xlsx, AUDAS99PEAKS.xlsx, USOHO99PEAKS.xlsx, MYPSO99PEAKS.xlsx, USSRM99PEAKS.xlsx, USSRC99PEAKS.xlsx, AURIG99PEAKS.xlsx, and USSRG99PEAKS.xlsx contain the data of peak values Amax for top 1% of fluctuations for c at 99% quantile for each site.
3. These excel files are used to produce Figure 5 in the manuscript entitled 'Characterizing Time Asymmetry of Ecosystem Net Carbon Exchange as a Signature of Thermodynamic Irreversibility', which illustartes the Comparison of peak values Amax for all fluctuations at c=0 and top 1% of fluctuations for c at 99% quantile for each site.
